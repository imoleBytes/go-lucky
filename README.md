# BLOCKCHAIN JOURNEY STARTS HERE

## Description of Project Go Lucky

This Web3 project is a luck-based staking platform where users compete in a high-stakes game of chance.
Participants enter the game by staking 100 tokens, competing against 100 other players.
At the end of each round, one player is randomly selected as the winner, 
receiving a prize of 10,000 tokens minus a 2,000 token platform fee.
